The Horned Frog sports teams are members of the NCAA Division I Big XII Conference and are especially competitive in football. The unusual mascot is a small lizard and is also the official state reptile of Texas. Volunteer activities are a particularly big draw for students, and the school's Center for Community Involvement & Service-Learning coordinates excursions like service trips over spring break. The campus is about five miles from downtown Fort Worth, a historic area that still has an Old West feel. Students can check out live bull riding shows at Billy Bob's, a restaurant that is billed as the world's largest honky-tonk, or catch a rodeo at the Cowtown Coliseum. Dallas is about 35 miles away.",

   "name": "University of Delaware",
   "description": "For students interested in attending the University of Delaware, it pays to live in the state. The University of Delaware admits all Delaware residents whose academic records predict success, and about 65 percent who apply will be accepted. About half (45-55 percent) of all out-of-state applicants are admitted. For all who receive admission, there are more than 400 student clubs and organizations on the school's lush campus in downtown Newark. Nearly 20 percent of students are involved in the school's large Greek system, which has about 40 fraternities and sororities. The Fightin' Blue Hens sports teams, named after a Delaware Revolutionary War battalion with the same nickname, compete in the NCAA Division I Colonial Athletic Association. The mascot is a costumed bird named YoUDee, and a group of live Blue Hen chickens reside on the school farm. Freshmen must live on campus, unless they commute from a parent's local home. When students want to leave campus, Wilmington is about 12 miles away. Philadelphia is a 45-mile drive and Baltimore is 55 miles away. The University of Delaware ran the nation's first study abroad program in 1923, and, these days, about a third of undergraduates opt to spend time in another country.",

   "name": "Auburn University",
   "description": "Auburn, Alabama, has been ranked one of the best places to live, and life at Auburn University can be similarly enjoyable for students. Football is a particularly big attraction in the fall, as fans support the Auburn Tigers with the help of school mascot Aubie the Tiger. The Tiger sports teams compete in the NCAA Division I Southeastern Conference, and the influx of football fans makes Auburn the fifth-largest city in the state on game days. Pep rallies are held in the downtown Toomer's Corner, and the area is covered in toilet paper by fans after every big victory. There are more than 500 student organizations on campus, and about 6,000 students are involved in the school's Greek system. Auburn freshmen ease into the college transition through Camp War Eagle, a two-day, overnight summer orientation program. Transition help continues on Hey Day, an annual effort to get students to wear name tags and say hello to one another. Freshmen do not have to live on campus; in fact, a dorm room isn't even guaranteed. Because of space restraints, first-year students are awarded on-campus living assignments on a first-come, first-served basis.",

Together, the schools make up the Higher Education Consortium of Central Massachusetts.
